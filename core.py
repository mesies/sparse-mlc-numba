import sklearn as sk
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# 1. Load dataset
#   1.1 Load data from delicious dataset, also use sklearn's sparse data structures.
#       Use pandas then use scipy sparse matrix data structure
#   1.2 Split into train/test sets according to delicious_trSplit.txt and delicious_tstSplit.txt, both files
#       contain indexes.

# 2. Implement Binary Logistic Regression Classifier
#   2.1 Code likelihood
#   2.2 Code Stochastic Gradient Descent with regards to dataset sparsity
#
# Notes : Code it like sklearn classifiers

# 3. Implement Classifier Chains
#   3.1 Code classifier chains with regards to interchangeable classifiers objects

# 4. Implement Scoring Function
#   4.1 Code Scoring function as described in report.pdf
